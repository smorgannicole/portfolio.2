            I was first introduced to coding in my CS Fundamentals class during
            my second year of collegeâ€” I finished with a C.

            Five years later I attended both Codeup and LEARN Academy's full
            stack web development bootcamps. Despite Codeup's closure midway
            through the course, my time at LEARN Academy reinforced my skills in
            frontend languages and libraries like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            React. If I went back now, I'd like to think I could make at least a
            B in CS Fundamentals.

            Outside of work, I enjoy friendly games of chess (add me on
            chess.com @smorgannicole), any spectator sport, live music,
            discovering the magic of the world with my partner, and spending
            quality time with my animals.

              I decided to present over Accessibility in Frontend Development
              because everyone, especially differently-abled people, are
              beneficiaries to an accessible digital world. I believe we should
              always strive to make the world easier for others to navigate{" "}
